Welcome to the LocationTech Geoff Project!
===================


The Geoff project consists of a set of Eclipse plugins for visualizing geodata within Eclipse RCPs (or the Eclipse IDE). It uses OpenLayers3 as a rendering engine. It is extensible by means of the Eclipse plugins extension mechanisms. This is shown by the exemplary geo map designer plugins shipped with Geoff. The geo map designer allows you to design geographical maps within your Eclipse IDE and publish the resulting map to your website:
